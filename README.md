# :wave: StackOverflow Clone Web App (Soen 341) :wave:

## Objective :trophy:

Implement a simplified version of StackOverflow, a Q&A platform, that enables users to ask and answer questions, vote for each other's answers, and authorize the OP (Original Poster) to accept the best answer


## Description :pencil2:

Build a simplified version of StackOverflow, which is essentially a Q&A website that enables users to ask questions or share their knowledge of programming by answering questions posted by other users.  The community can indicate which answers are most valuable and appropriate by upvoting them. Users can upvote any answer they want except for their own, and only the OP, the Original Poster of a question, gets to accept the best response

*Extra Feature: A user is awarded 10 reputation points for receiving an upvote on an answer to a question* 


## Core Features :point_down:

  * **For URGENT Bugs** 
    * hotfix-(issue_number) <br>
  
**:green_circle: &nbsp; For Issues** 
     * **Syntax:** [#Github_Hash: FEATURE/BUG] Issue Topic <br>
