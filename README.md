# :wave: StackOverflow Clone Web App (Soen 341) :wave: <br>


## Objective :trophy:

Implement a simplified version of StackOverflow, a Q&A platform, that enables users to ask and answer questions, vote for each other's answers, and authorize the OP (Original Poster) to accept the best answer


## Description :pencil2:

Build a simplified version of StackOverflow, which is essentially a Q&A website that enables users to ask questions or share their knowledge of programming by answering questions posted by other users.  The community can indicate which answers are most valuable and appropriate by upvoting them. Users can upvote any answer they want except for their own, and only the OP, the Original Poster of a question, gets to accept the best response

*Extra Feature: Add Comment Sections Under Both Questions And Answers (W/ Voting Functionality)*

## Workflow Tips :bulb:

:one: &nbsp; Make your changes and save your code <br>
:two: &nbsp; Checkout to a new_branch (using the above naming conventions) <br>
:three: &nbsp; Add, Commit, and Push these changes to the new_branch <br>
:four: &nbsp; Push this branch to Github <br>
:five: &nbsp; Address an Issue / have your code added to main/master by creating a PR: (Main) <--- (new_branch) <br>

## Naming Conventions (for Git & Github organization) :green_book:

* **Syntax:** feature-(#issue_number/Issue-Topic) <br>
* **Example:** feature-(#40/Add-a-README.md-File) <br><br>
   
**:green_circle: &nbsp; Naming Convention Used For Issues** <br>
* **Syntax:** [#issue_number: FEATURE/BUG] Issue Topic <br>
* **Example:** [#40: FEATURE] Add a README.md File <br><br>
